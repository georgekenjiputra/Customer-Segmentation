## Objective

The objective of this project is to analyze customer data, apply clustering analysis to identify distinct customer segments and provide tailored recommendations to the company based on each segment's characteristics. The project aims to improve customer targeting, enhance loyalty, and optimize business strategies for different customer groups. Additionally, the project seeks to explore and implement automated techniques for determining the optimal number of clusters and involve domain experts to provide valuable insights and guidance. The ultimate goal is to enhance the effectiveness of the clustering approach and maximize the benefits for the company and its customers.

## Conclusion

The project involved conducting an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to examine the dataset, revealing correlated features and a positive correlation between customer balances and purchases. Through evaluation methods such as the elbow method, silhouette score method, and Davies-Bouldin index method, the optimal number of clusters (k=3) was determined. The resulting clusters were reasonably balanced, with Cluster 0 representing affluent and frequent buyers, Cluster 1 consisting of customers who spend less and rely on cash advances, and Cluster 2 comprising moderate spenders with a balanced approach to purchases. Tailored recommendations were provided for each cluster, including VIP treatment and personalized incentives for Cluster 0, financial education and alternative cash advance options for Cluster 1, and credit limit increases and financial planning tools for Cluster 2.

The project highlighted the strengths of the K-Means algorithm, such as its speed and efficiency, making it suitable for real-time applications. However, the challenge of determining the optimal value for k was acknowledged, which can be subjective and dependent on domain knowledge. To improve the clustering process, suggestions were made to implement automated techniques, involve domain experts, and explore alternative clustering algorithms such as DBSCAN or GMM. These recommendations aimed to reduce subjectivity, leverage domain expertise, and enhance the effectiveness of the clustering approach. The overall objective of the project was to analyze customer data, identify distinct segments, and provide tailored recommendations to optimize customer targeting, loyalty, and business strategies.
